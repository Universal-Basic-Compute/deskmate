## Visual Design Language

### Color Palette
- **Base**: Dark grey (#212121) provides a sophisticated, distraction-free foundation
- **Primary**: Vibrant yellow (#FFD100) creates energy and optimism
- **Accent**: Violet (#9C27B0) adds depth and visual interest
- **Gradients**: Yellow-to-orange transitions create dynamic, warm interactions

### Lighting Effects
- **Light Cone**: Radial gradients emanate from key UI elements, simulating a focused beam of light
  - **Dynamic Properties**: Light cones breathe, shift, and respond to user interaction
  - **Contextual Adaptation**: Light characteristics change based on app state, time, and user activity
  - **Transition Guide**: Light leads transitions between screens and states
- **Glow Effects**: Subtle shadows and luminescence around interactive elements enhance depth
- **Gradient Masks**: Text and icons utilize gradient overlays for visual richness
- **Particle Effects**: Achievement moments trigger particle bursts emanating from the light source

### Animation Principles
- **Organic Movement**: Light cones move with natural, organic motion rather than mechanical precision
- **Responsive Feedback**: Interactive elements respond to touch with light amplification
- **State Reflection**: App states (focus, break, achievement) are reflected in light behavior
- **Subtle Breathing**: Background light effects subtly pulse to create a sense of life
- **Purposeful Motion**: All animations serve functional purposes rather than being purely decorative

### Design Principles
- **Focus-Oriented**: Dark background minimizes eye strain during extended study sessions
- **Warm Accents**: Yellow/orange elements create an encouraging, positive atmosphere
- **Depth Through Light**: Rather than traditional shadows, light sources create dimension
- **Consistent Metaphor**: The "desk lamp" lighting concept reinforces the study companion theme
- **Emotional Design**: Light qualities evoke appropriate emotional states for different activities
